<p style="color: black;font-size: 20px">REFUND POLICY</p>

Considering the nature of the CD key we sell, a refund is possible, but a deadline of 7 days may be necessary for us to check if the code is not used.

Refunds or credits will be issued solely at GabenStore&#8217 discretion. Refunds may be offered if all the following conditions are met:
<ul>
<li> The time of your request for refund is no more than 7 days from time of purchase</li>

<li> The game has not been activated or downloaded</li>

<li> The game activation key (including any bonus or beta keys) have not been disclosed to you by email or webpage</li>

<li> We find your request reasonable due to special circumstances</li>
</ul>
Please note: This means that NO refunds will be offered for MMO titles, Steam, UPlay and Origin titles where the key has been disclosed to you or sent by e-mail. All such sales are final.

<p style="color: black;font-size: 20px">RETURN POLICY</p>

If, in the unlikely event you receive a key that does not activate your game, simply Contact Us at support@gabenstore.com and we will check the key for you. In most of the cases, a key that does not allow you to activate your game will be an error in transmission, for example a spelling error in the cd key code. So please simply write to us, and we will double check the key and re-send it.
